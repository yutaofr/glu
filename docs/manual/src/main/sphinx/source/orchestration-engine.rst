|orchestration-engine-logo| Orchestration engine
================================================
The orchestration engine is the heart of the whole system. Its responsibility is to listen to ZooKeeper events (coming from the glu agents), compute the :term:`delta` and orchestrate the deployment plans.

.. note:: Currently the orchestration engine is bundled with the console and is not running as a separate process. Please check the :doc:`console <console>` documentation regarding installation and configuration.

.. _goe-tracker:

|tracker-logo| Tracker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The role of the tracker is to listen to ZooKeeper events. Under the cover, the tracker uses `ZooKeeper watches <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.1/zookeeperOver.html#Conditional+updates+and+watches>`_. This makes the tracker very leightweight and efficient as it receives notifications only when something changes in the system. 

For example, it gets notified immediately when:

* a new agent is added (case when a new node is added to the system)
* an agent disappears (case when a node crashes or reboot for example)
* a script state changes
* ...

From the information collected (and updated real-time) by the tracker, the orchestration engine can compute the :ref:`live model <goe-live-model>`.

.. _goe-live-model:

|live-model-logo| Live Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`live model` is computed by the orchestration engine from the information collected by the :ref:`tracker <goe-tracker>`. The live model is the representation of the :term:`live state` which is used for computing the :ref:`delta <goe-delta>`. Besides being used as an input to the :ref:`delta service <goe-delta-service>` in order to compute the delta, the live model has several representation that you have access to:

From the console
""""""""""""""""
If you navigate to an agent view page in the console, and for any given entry you click on the ``View Details`` (toggle), you will see something like this:

.. image:: /images/goe-live-model-console-600.gif
   :align: center
   :alt: console entry detail

The information displayed here is exactly what the tracker has captured from ZooKeeper.

.. note:: In this screenshot you can even see how the script running on the remote agent has detected a failure and reported it. Thanks to ZooKeeper watches, the failure is propagated real-time and made available so that the user can fix the problem.

From the command line
"""""""""""""""""""""

From a shell terminal, you can issue::

  ./bin/console-cli.sh -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -b -l status

The important flag is ``-l`` which request the *live* model. You get an output very similar to the one in the console (more detailed though)::

.. note::
   without any filter (see :doc:`filtering`), you will get the entire model, not just the single entry. In order to select a single entry you can use the filter shortcut ``-I agent-1:/sample/i001`` like this::

     ./bin/console-cli.sh -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -b -l -I agent-1:/sample/i001 status
   

.. _goe-static-model:

|static-model-logo| Static Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`static model` is an input to the orchestration engine. It describes the state of the entire system (for a given :term:`fabric`). The static model gets *loaded* in the orchestration engine either from the console web application, REST api or command line (``-m`` option). Once loaded, the static model remains the *current* model until a new one is loaded.

.. tip:: Check out the separate entry about the :doc:`static model <static-model>` for more information.

.. _goe-delta-service:

|delta-service-logo| Delta Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The delta service is in charge of computing the :ref:`delta <goe-delta>` between the :ref:`live model <goe-live-model>` and the :ref:`static model <goe-static-model>`. As mentionned previously, the static model used is the latest one that was loaded (or selected as current). The live model is coming from the :ref:`tracker <goe-tracker>`.

.. note:: 
   In the event that there is an issue with the connection to ZooKeeper, the delta service will still be able to generate *deltas* but they will be flagged accordingly because the live model is no longer real-time. In the output of the :ref:`live model <goe-live-model>` you can see this in action (in this case there was no problem)::

    "metadata": {
      "accuracy": "ACCURATE",
      ...
    }

.. _goe-delta:

|delta-logo| Delta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`delta` is the result of the computation done by the :ref:`delta service <goe-delta-service>`. The delta is fed into the :ref:`visualizer <goe-visualizer>` and/or the :ref:`planner <goe-planner>`.

.. note:: At this moment, the delta is an internal concept not directly available but as it is driving the visualizer and planner, you have the ability to see different representations of it.

.. _goe-visualizer:

|visualizer-logo| Visualizer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The visualizer is in charge of turning the delta into a *visual* representation. This is represented in the console by the dashboard:

.. image:: /images/goe-visualizer-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: console dashboard

In this screenshot which represents 3 applications deployed on 1 agent (coming from the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`) you can directly see the delta in action: 

* when a row is green (2nd row), it means that there is actually no delta: the static model and the live model are identical (or another way to say it, is that the desired state matches the live state)
* when a row is red (1st and 3rd row), it means that there is a discrepancy between the static model and the live model. The last column (``status``) is giving more information about what kind of delta was detected:
   * for row 1, the application is actually deployed but is not running (this is what you can see in the screenshot for the :ref:`live model <goe-live-model>`): the entry appears in the live model but with a mismatching state
   * for row 3, the application is not deployed at all: the entry is totally absent from the live model

.. _goe-planner:

|planner-logo| Planner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The planner is in charge of turning the delta into a :ref:`deployment plan <goe-plan>`.

.. _goe-plan:

|plan-logo| Deployment Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`deployment plan` is the set of instructions (generated by the :ref:`planner <goe-planner>`) which can be fed to the :ref:`deployer <goe-deployer>` in order to *fix* the delta computed by the :ref:`delta service <goe-delta-service>`. The idea is that if all instructions get executed successfully, then there won't be any delta anymore. 

An instruction is (usually) a call (using the secure REST api) to an agent to perform a particular action (as described in the section ":ref:`agent-glu-script-engine`").

.. note:: 
   As mentionned in the :doc:`index` section, the plan is **never** executed unless **you** give your explicit approval.

The deployment plan has several representations:

From the Console
""""""""""""""""

Using the same delta you could visualize on the :ref:`dashboard <goe-visualizer>`, the planner can compute various plans depending on what you instruct it to do.

From the console, you have the ability to 

* select a sequential plan:

  .. image:: /images/goe-plan-sequential.png
     :align: center
     :alt: console sequential plan

* select a parallel plan:

  .. image:: /images/goe-plan-parallel.png
     :align: center
     :alt: console parallel plan

.. note:: the numbers in front of each instruction show you in which order they will be executed. A parallel plan will execute much faster than a sequential plan since the instructions will run in parallel so you don't have to wait for previous instructions to complete. In a sequential plan, an error in an instruction will abort the entire remaining of the plan.

From the Command Line
"""""""""""""""""""""

The exact same data is also available from the command line (hence the REST api)::

  ./bin/console-cli.sh -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -a -n deploy

will produce the following output (sequential)::

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <plan name="origin=rest - action=deploy - filter=all - SEQUENTIAL" fabric="glu-dev-1" 
        systemId="4836742aa34f6915fae3c0f46fbcc86ea381df74" savedTime="1302892719254">
    <sequential origin="rest" action="deploy" filter="all">
      <sequential agent="agent-1" mountPoint="/sample/i001">
        <leaf name="Start agent-1:/sample/i001 on agent-1" />
      </sequential>
      <sequential agent="agent-1" mountPoint="/sample/i003">
        <leaf name="Install script for installation agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Install agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Configure agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Start agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
      </sequential>
    </sequential>
  </plan>

And the command (``-p`` means parallel)::

  ./bin/console-cli.sh -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -a -n -p deploy

will produce the following output (parallel)::

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <plan name="origin=rest - action=deploy - filter=all - PARALLEL" fabric="glu-dev-1" 
        systemId="4836742aa34f6915fae3c0f46fbcc86ea381df74" savedTime="1302892859008">
    <parallel origin="rest" action="deploy" filter="all">
      <sequential agent="agent-1" mountPoint="/sample/i001">
        <leaf name="Start agent-1:/sample/i001 on agent-1" />
      </sequential>
      <sequential agent="agent-1" mountPoint="/sample/i003">
        <leaf name="Install script for installation agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Install agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Configure agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
        <leaf name="Start agent-1:/sample/i003 on agent-1" />
      </sequential>
    </parallel>
  </plan>

.. note:: The ``-n`` option means *dry-run* and it allows you to display the deployment plan instead of executing it!

.. _goe-deployer:

|deployer-logo| Deployer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deployer is responsible to execute the :ref:`deployment plan <goe-plan>` computed by the :ref:`planner <goe-planner>`. The deployer knows how to deploy arbitrarily complex deployment plans (sequential / parallel nested at any level) and reports its progress as it goes along, allowing the very dynamic view available in the console:

.. image:: /images/goe-deployer-in-action.png
   :align: center
   :alt: deployer in action

.. note:: as you can see on the screenshot, every running action can be cancelled in the event there is a need for it.

.. note:: 
   the command line is also using the reporting capabilities of the deployer to display a progress bar:

   .. image:: /images/tutorial/tutorial-plan-progress-cli.png
      :align: center
      :alt: plan progress from the cli

.. _goe-rest-api:

REST api
--------
The orchestration engine offers a REST api (served by the console webapp).

.. note:: You do not have to use the REST api directly: there is a convenient :ref:`command line interface (cli) <goe-cli>` which is already using it. You would use the REST api directly, in cases when the cli is not enough or you want to have more control for example.

Security / Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The security model is simply implementing http basic authorization: every request needs to come with an ``Authorization`` header with the following format::

    Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>

.. note:: The username and password are only slightly obfuscated (base 64) but it is not an issue because the cli talks to the console over https and as a result the headers are never traveling over an insecure channel.


.. tip:: You can change the way authentication and authorization are handled entirely by writing your own plugin!

A few concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may wonder what is the difference between the 3 notions exposed by the REST API: plans, current deployments and archived deployments.

* A plan (as exposed by the ``/plans*`` APIs) simply represents a list of instructions that glu *will* execute. If you use the console, you can get a good idea of what a plan looks like:

   .. image:: /images/tutorial/tutorial-select-plan-2.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Dashboard shows the delta

  Currently a plan only lives (for a short time) in memory, between the time it gets created (``POST /plans``) and the time it gets executed. There is no persistent storage. 

  .. note:: this may change in the future as it would be convenient to create a plan just once and execute it at a later time or repeatedly.

* Once the plan is created and you execute it (``POST /plan/<planId>/execution``), it becomes a deployment and 2 things happen:

  1. a memory representation of the deployment is created: the current deployment
  2. a database entry is created for this deployment: the archived deployment

* The current deployment lives in memory because it is used by the orchestration engine to execute the steps that needs to happen. It is dynamically updated as steps complete. The current deployment will remain in memory (even after it completes) until either you shutdown the console (so the memory is gone...) or you archive it. The current deployment contains more details than the archived one and can be seen in the console when clicking on the `Plans` tab.

* The archived deployment is created (in the database) when the plan starts executing and then it is updated again **only** when the current deployment completes (whether it was successful or not). The archived deployment is permanent (because it is stored in the database) and can be seen in the console when clicking on the `Plans/Archived` tab.

.. tip:: There is a relationship between a plan execution and the current and archived plan: the ``executionId`` is in fact the 
   ``deploymentId``::

         GET /plans/<planId>/executions/<executionId>

         is equivalent to 

         GET /deployment/current/<executionId>

         and if you want to access the archived version you can issue

         GET /deployment/archived/<executionId>

.. warning:: Currently, the ``/plans*`` APIs are only dealing with the plans that have been created through the REST API. The plans created and executed from the web interface use a different mechanism and won't appear in those calls. This will be adressed in an upcoming release. The ``/deployments*`` calls work whether the REST API or the web interface was used.

* Description: This call should be used in the scenario when you want to `decommission` a node: all data stored in ZooKeeper in regards to this agent will be wiped out.

* Request: ``DELETE /agent/<agentName>``

.. _goe-rest-api-put-agent-fabric:

Assign a fabric to an agent
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Description: Assigns a fabric to an agent (and optionally configures it)

* Request: ``PUT /agent/<agentName>/fabric``

  optional request parameters:

  * ``host=<ip or hostname>`` for configuring the agent using the ip or the hostname of the agent (this assumes that the configuration port is ``12907``)
  * ``uri=<configuration uri>`` for configuring the agent using the given uri (this form allows you to use a different port (ex: ``http://x.x.x.x:13906/config``))

* Response: 

  * ``200`` (``OK``)
  * ``400`` (``BAD REQUEST``) if missing or unknown fabric
  * ``409`` (``CONFLICT``) when the configuration phase failed

     curl -v -u "glua:password" -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/console/rest/v1/glu-dev-1/agent/xeon/fabric?host=127.0.0.1"
     < HTTP/1.1 200 OK

.. tip:: "Configuring" the agent means that the orchestration engine will issue a REST call to the agent with its own ZooKeeper connect string as configuration. This allows the use case where the agent is started without a ZooKeeper at all, so the agent is simply waiting for somebody to tell it where is his ZooKeeper.
         This is what you see in the agent log::

             Waiting for glu.agent.zkConnectString (rest:put:http://xeon.local:12907)

Read/Wait for command result
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Once a command has been started, this api will retrieve the result(s) and optionally wait. If you request more than one stream, then you will get a muliplexed stream of results (the format is fairly simple and you can take a look at the java code on how to demultiplex it. TODO: add python code for demultiplexing/example).

  * ``stdinOffset=...`` where to start in stdin stream in number of bytes (negative number counts backward) (default: ``0``)
  * ``stdinLen=...`` how many bytes max to read for stdin (default: ``-1`` => read all)
  * ``exitValueStream=true`` include the exit value (which is what the shell command returned: ``$?``) (default: ``false``)
  * ``exitValueStreamTimeout=...`` if the command is not completed yet, how long to wait (meaning block) until the result is returned (0 means wait until completed). Can be any timespan (ex: ``5s``, ``10m``, ``50`` for 50 milliseconds) (default: don't wait!)
  * ``exitErrorStream=true`` include the error stream (when an exception is generated for any reason, usually communication) (default: ``false``)

+--------------------------+----------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: ``planAction=stop`` is equivalent to ``planType=transition&state=stopped``. The ``planType`` notation is more generic and should be used when using your own state machine or creating your own custom plan types (in which case you can also pass as many parameters as you want).

.. note:: ``maxParallelStepsCount`` only makes sense when ``order`` is set to ``parallel``. Setting this value to ``1`` is equivalent to defining ``order=sequential``.

.. _goe-plugins:

Plugins
-------

The orchestration engine offers a plugin mechanism which allows you to hook into some specific phases to tweak and/or change the behavior. For example, the ``UserService_pre_authenticate`` hook allows you to bypass entirely the login/authentication mechanism that comes built-in and instead provide your own.

What is a plugin?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A plugin is simply a class with (groovy) closures, each of them defining a specific hook. You can define as many or as little of those closures as you want and you can *spread* them accross different classes (for example, you can have a plugin class handling only the *deployment* related plugin hooks, and another handling the hooks for a different part of the system). If a closure is missing, then it will simply not be called.

.. tip:: The class `DocumentationPlugin <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/tree/master/orchestration/org.linkedin.glu.orchestration-engine/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/glu/orchestration/engine/plugins/builtin/DocumentationPlugin.groovy>`_ is meant to be an hexaustive list of all the hooks available as well as a documentation on how to use them. It also serves as an example of how to write a plugin!

How do you install a plugin?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to install your plugins(s), you need to first package them as jar file(s). Then it is just a matter of editing the appropriate section in the :ref:`meta model <meta-model-console>` to let glu know where they are. For example::

  consoles << [
    host: 'localhost',
    plugins: [
      [
        fqcn: 'org.acme.glu.plugin.MyPlugin', 
        classPath: ['http://repository/myplugin.jar', 'http://repository/dependency.jar']
      ],
      // ... more plugins
    ],
  ]

* ``fqcn`` is the fully qualified class name of your plugin

  .. note::
     The class of your plugin **must** be present in one of the jar files specified in the ``classPath`` section

* ``classPath`` is a list of URIs containing the various jars comprising your plugin (base class + dependencies).

List of hooks available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip:: For full documentation and typical use cases, refer to the class `DocumentationPlugin <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/tree/master/orchestration/org.linkedin.glu.orchestration-engine/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/glu/orchestration/engine/plugins/builtin/DocumentationPlugin.groovy>`_.

* Initialization

  * ``PluginService_initialize``: called for initializing your plugin

* User management

  * ``UserService_pre_authenticate``: called before authentication
  * ``UserService_post_authenticate``: called after authentication
  * ``UserService_pre_authorize``: called before authorization
  * ``UserService_post_authorize``: called after authorization
  * ``UserService_pre_restAuthenticateAndAuthorize``: called before REST authentication and authorization flow
  * ``UserService_post_restAuthenticateAndAuthorize``: called after REST authentication and authorization flow

* Model

  * ``SystemService_pre_parseSystemModel``: called before parsing the system model
  * ``SystemService_post_parseSystemModel``: called after parsing the system model

* Plans

  * ``PlannerService_pre_computePlans``: called before computing a deployment plan
  * ``PlannerService_post_computePlans``: called after computing a deployment plan

* Deployment

  * ``DeploymentService_pre_executeDeploymentPlan``: called before executing a deployment plan
  * ``DeploymentService_onStart_executeDeploymentPlan``: called when the deployment plan starts executing
  * ``DeploymentService_post_executeDeploymentPlan``: called after executing a deployment plan  

* Commands

  * ``CommandsService_pre_executeCommand``: called before executing a command
  * ``CommandsService_post_executeCommand``: called when the command is complete
  * ``FileSystemCommandExecutionIOStorage_createInputStream``: called to create the input stream to read the IO of the command from the filesystem
  * ``FileSystemCommandExecutionIOStorage_createOutputStream``:called to create the output stream to write the IO of the command from the filesystem

Future hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the plugin mechanism is in place, adding new hooks is not very complicated. If you have specific requirements for a new hook, please open a ticket on the `glu ticketing system <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues>`_.

.. _goe-cli:


Command Line
------------
The orchestration engine also comes with a cli which is essentially a wrapper around the REST api which can be used in several ways:

* directly to issue commands
* to build higher level cli(s) which use this cli as a base
* as an example for how to talk to the REST api directly

The cli currently requires python 2.6 to run.

Help
^^^^
This is the output when using the ``-h`` option

Usage::

 console-cli.py -f <fabric> <start|stop|bounce|deploy|undeploy|redeploy|load|status> [flags]

.. note:: The orchestration engine cli is currently called ``console-cli`` because of the fact that the orchestration engine is currently running inside the console.

Options:

.. option:: --version

Unless you run the cli on the same host as the console you will need to specify its location:

    Example::

       -c https://glu.console.host:8443/console
    
Here are some examples of usage::

    # View the current loaded model (and format it for readability):
    ./bin/console-cli.py -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -b status
    
    # View the live model only for applications in cluster cluster-1 (and format it for readability):
    ./bin/console-cli.py -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -b -l -s "metadata.cluster='cluster-1'" status
    
    # Show me what will happen if I bounce all applcations in cluster cluster-1 (but don't do it!):
    ./bin/console-cli.py -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -s "metadata.cluster='cluster-1'" -n bounce

    # Bounce all applcations in cluster cluster-1:
    ./bin/console-cli.py -f glu-dev-1 -u admin -x admin -s "metadata.cluster='cluster-1'" bounce
